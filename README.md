## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

# News Homepage

A responsive, multi-column homepage for a news website, built with a modern layout and an interactive mobile menu.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "News homepage" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The main objective was to create a modern and visually appealing homepage that is fully responsive. The project demonstrates the power of **CSS Grid** for building a complex, multi-section layout and uses **JavaScript** to implement a functional and smooth-working mobile navigation menu.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the news articles, headers, and navigation elements.
* **CSS3:** The primary technology for styling the page. **CSS Grid** was used to create the complex, two-dimensional layout of the articles. CSS also handles the responsive design and the animations for the mobile menu.
* **JavaScript:** Used to handle the interactivity of the hamburger menu. It listens for a click event to toggle a class that shows or hides the navigation menu overlay on mobile screens.

## Features

* **Complex Responsive Grid:** The layout is built using CSS Grid to ensure articles are displayed in a visually appealing and organized manner on all devices.
* **Interactive Mobile Menu:** A hamburger menu appears on mobile, and JavaScript handles the functionality to show/hide the navigation links.
* **Clean & Modern UI:** The design is sharp, with clear typography and a well-defined color scheme.
